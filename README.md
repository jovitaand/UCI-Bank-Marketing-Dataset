# UCI-Bank-Marketing-Dataset

The UCI Bank Marketing Dataset is a collection of data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

### Target Variable:
- **y**: Binary variable indicating if the client subscribed to a term deposit (`yes` or `no`).

### Applications:

### Dataset Size:
- **Rows**: 41,188 instances
- **Columns**: 20 features

The dataset is frequently used in machine learning projects for binary classification tasks and is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
